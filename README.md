Nashville Bitcoin Network Bylaws
======

This is the first draft of the bylaws for the National Bitcoin Network. They are a fork from the Bitcoin Foundation bylaws, so there is much here that will need to be changed before it accurately reflects our interests. Please make a pull request for any changes you would like to make, or create an "issue" if there is something about this you'd like to discuss with all contributors.
